	Installing xtush could not be easier (well, okay, it could, but..)

You'll need to know what 'type' of unix you are on. The main 'flavours' are
'bsd', such as SunOS 4, and 'sysv' (or System V), such as SunOS
5/solaris 2. If you don't have any idea what type of unix you're on, try the
command 'uname -a', which should tell you something. If you don't have any
idea, try compiling for one, and if it doesn't work, try changing the
Imakefile/Makefile to compile for the other.

1) Edit the file 'Imakefile'

	Everything is commented, so it should be obvious what to change
               
2) Edit the file 'config.h'

	You shouldn't really need to change anything in here. Though
	you can change it to suit your own tastes if you desire.

3) type 'xmkmf' then type 'make'

        This should compile everything with no problems.
	If you get an error at this point about 'xmkmf: Command not found.'
	then either you don't have X windows, or it's badly installed, or
	your path is wrong. There is a standard Makefile included for
	just these circumstances. Edit Makefile.std, change any bits you
	want to, and then type 'make -f Makefile.std'. If you still can't
	get it to work, then panic.

4) read the doc on how to use it (tush.doc), and away you go.
