This is xtush, a client for using talkers and muds. It is based on TUsh,
programmed by Simon Marsh (aka Burble), with some bugs fixed, and the addition
of some graphical support.

Please read the file INSTALL for details of compiling xtush, and tush.doc
for instructions of how to use it.

The graphics support added consists of two things. Firstly, it supports
the protocol used by the bsx graphics mud running in sweden.
  birka.lysator.liu.se 7475
This should just produce a graphics window which you can resize, but not do 
anything in.

Secondly, there is support for my own graphics protocol for a graphical
talker, where people can send graphics as well as text. This is supported to
some extent on foothills (toybox.infomagic.com 2010) and on underworld
(dismayl.demon.co.uk 2010).

If you turn graphics on there, you will get a window with a central drawing
area, some colours at the top, and some tool-buttons at the side. It should be
fairly intuitive how to draw things. Anything you draw will get sent via the
talker to anyone in the same room as you who also has graphics on, so you can
interactively doodle with people. If it just beeps when you try to draw
things, then you're in a room where drawing is disallowed.

If there are any bugs, feel free to contact me.
