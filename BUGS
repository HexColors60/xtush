What follows is a list of known bugs as of version 1.5

It should cope better with 24 bit displays and things, not sure if it's
totally fixed though. It is possible to 'force' xtush to behave as if on a 24
bit colour display or on a mono display by running xtush true (for 24 bit) or
xtush mono (for mono).

The spraypaint option doesn't work properly in black and white. All colours
just get done in black, without using the bitmask. Not sure how to get around
this, XDrawPoints just seems to ignore bitmasks.

Ctrl-y is used on some systems to suspend the process, so can't be used to
switch shells. All I can suggest for this is just use ctrl-u, which does the
same thing in the other direction. Alternatively, it should be possible to
disable the affect of ctrl-y using stty.

Possible bugs with ioctl on System V type machines. I'm not sure about
this. Also possible bugs with suspending and then reforegrounding.

xtush now tries to recognise control sequences (such as ansi sequences or
termcap sequences) in word wrapping, so hilighted/coloured stuff should
get wrapped properly, but this very kludgy, so if you have problems, turn
xtush wrapping off and let your terminal (eg xterm) do linewrapping.

There is apparently a bug in triggers, where a trigger like >* or something
will get set off for no apparent reason - this may be to do with terminal
control codes or something, I'll look into it sometime.

Probably lots of other bugs, but never mind. If you find anything buglike,
feel free to email me with details at jonathan@onlinemagic.co.uk
